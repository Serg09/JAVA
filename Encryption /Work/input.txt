There are two kinds of dreams.
There are dreams that we have while asleep and dreams that we have while we are awake.
What is the connection between the two types?
Both kinds of dreams are about the yearnings that are held deep inside us.
Some of these desires are so secret that we dare not share them even with our closest friends.
Those of us that dare to put our dreams down on paper are showing the courage and faith that they will come true.
